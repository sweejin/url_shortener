<!-- We will now create a form so that a user can key in a URL. In app/views/urls, create a file named _form.html.erb, take note of the underscore! The underscore here represents that the view file we are creating is a partial view file and can be reused instead of typing out the form again and again (imagine having to create the same form for new and edit!). -->

<%= form_for @url do |f| %>
  <p>
    <%= f.label "Type your URL here:" %><br>
    <%= f.text_field :long_url %>
  </p>

  <p>
    <%= f.submit "Shorten URL!" %>
  </p>
    <% end %>

<!-- Here we are using the form helper form_for so that we can bind this form to our Url model. It is also best practice to use form_for if your form takes in values that are attributes of an Active Record object. -->
